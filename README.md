# Github REST API
Three different requests to the Github API

This application it's composed with a main page that allows us to select three links. First two redirects to another page which consists in a brief description of the problem, a user text input box and a button to submit the request to the API. Then the data is retrieved and showed just below the text input.
Third and last option simply do the same procedure to retrive the data but insted of redirect to another page just shows the info using a Javascript alert box.
